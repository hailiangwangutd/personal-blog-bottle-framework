The Google News Crawler was designed for collecting most recently news in Google News. 

You may type in key words and how many pages to download. By just click 'search' button, then news would download at the same directory with the program, in txt format seperately.

How to use: 
1. install python3 and all related packages;                                                          2. run googleCrawlerPython3.py;                                                                       3. type in key words and page, then search.

Note: Google is smart, I am not responsble for your IP being blocked(usually couple of minutes), if you download plenty of news.
